                    class="text-body-secondary"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">There are numerous sensors providing data for the central computer of the vehicle during
                operation. Sensors provide information for the road, other vehicles on the road as well as any other
                impediments that can be noticed similarly to how a human can perceive them (Khayyam et al., 2019). Some
                of these sensors can provide better perception than the average human, but for this to happen we need
                smart algorithms that can make sense of the data streams generated in real time.
                <br>
                One of the main tasks is to detect and identify objects ahead and around the vehicle (Sagar and
                Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019). Artificial neural networks (ANN) are the algorithms typically used for this
                task. Another term for this field is deep learning, because a neural network contains many layers that
                contain many nodes.
                <br>he analysis of video input uses machine learning algorithms and most likely neural networks in order
                to classify objects. Since we have multiple sensors of different kind it makes sense to have dedicated
                hardware/software modules for each sensor. This approach allows for parallel processing of data and
                therefore faster decision making. Each sensor unit can utilize a different AI algorithm and then
                communicate its results to the other units or the central processing computer.

            <p class="lead">Path planning is important in order to optimize the trajectory of the vehicle and to lead to
                better traffic patterns. This can help reduce delays and avoid congestion on the road. Planning is a
                very suitable task for artificial intelligence algorithms. It is a dynamic task that can take into
                consideration a lot of factors and can solve an optimization problem while executing the path. The
                following definition of path planning is given: ”path planning for AVs enables self-driving vehicles to
                find the safest, most convenient, and most economically beneficial routes from point A to point B by
                using the previous driving experiences which help the AI agent make much more accurate decisions in the
                future”.<br>The majority of path-planning algorithms work well in simulations and laboratory robots, but
                real- world robots operate in unknown surroundings and interact with other agents whose motion is often
                unpredictable and whose conduct can be uncooperative. Real robots have inherent kinematical and
                dynamical (kinodynamical) constraints that make autonomous collision-free motion impossible in
                particular circumstances. </p>

            <p class="lead">After the path is planned the vehicle is able to navigate the road conditions, by detecting
                objects, pedestrians, bicycles and traffic lights in order to reach the destination. The object
                detection algorithms are a primary focus of the AI community as they make it possible for human like
                behavior. The challenges come when different road and weather conditions come into play. Many accidents
                with testing vehicles happened because the simulation environment is different from the real world
                conditions and the AI software may react unpredictably when given unknown data.<br>The main idea
                underlying PRM, on the other hand, is to pick random samples from the robot's configuration space, test
                them to see whether they are in the free space, and then use a local planner to connect these
                configurations to other adjacent configurations.The beginning and goal configurations are brought in,
                and the resulting graph is subjected to a graph search algorithm in order to find a path between them.
                To assess the performance of the recommended approaches, simulations and experiments are carried out.

                    class="text-body-secondary"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">The most promising type of maintenance is predictive maintenance. It can be defined in the
                following way: “Predictive maintenance employs monitoring and prediction modelling to determine the
                condition of the machine and to predict what is likely to fail and when it is going to happen”.<br> It
                tries to predict future problems, not problems that already exist. In this respect predictive
                maintenance can save a lot of time and money. Both supervised and unsupervised learning can be used for
                predictive maintenance.<br>The algorithms can use on-board and off-board data to make decision for
                predictive maintenance. The machine learning algorithms used for this task are classification algorithms
                like logistic regression, support vector machines and random forest algorithm.</p>

                    class="text-body-secondary"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Data logs from a vehicle can contain information about the driver’s behavior and this can be
                used in the analysis of traffic accidents. These data can be used for processing of claims.<br> All this
                can contribute to decrease in prices for insurance, since the safety is more deterministic and
                guaranteed. For fully automated cars the liability will shift from the passenger, who is no longer a
                driver, to the manufacturer.<br> In the semi-autonomous vehicle, we will still most likely have some
                liability of the driver. Proving these type of cases will rely more and more on smart data captured by
                the AI system of the vehicle. Data from all sensors generates enormous amounts of information.<br>
                Saving all the data at every moment may not be practical, but saving snapshots of relevant data seems
                the right balance of obtaining evidence that could be used for post analysis of a certain traffic event.
                This approach is similar to how black box information is stored and analyzed after a crash.</p>
